Project Description:
Volume Calculator is an Android app that simplifies the task of calculating the volume of various geometric shapes.
Users can easily input the necessary dimensions and select the desired shape from a gridview interface. The app then performs accurate calculations and displays the resulting volume.


Key Features:

1.Intuitive User Interface: A user-friendly gridview layout allows for easy shape selection and dimension input.
2. Accurate Calculations: The app ensures precise volume calculations based on established mathematical formulas.
3. Wide Range of Shapes: Supports a variety of shapes, including spheres, cubes, cylinders, pyramids, and more.
4. Mobile-Optimized: Designed specifically for Android devices, providing a seamless and efficient experience.


Technology Stack:
1. Android Studio: Used as the primary development environment.
2. Java: Programming language for app development.
3. XML: Used for designing the app's layout.
4. Android SDK: Provides the necessary tools and libraries for Android app development.


Future Enhancements:
1. Additional Shapes: Expand the app to include more complex shapes like cones and ellipsoids.
2. Unit Conversion: Allow users to convert between different units of measurement (e.g., cubic meters, cubic centimeters).
3. Saved Calculations: Implement a feature to save and recall previous calculations for easy reference.


This project demonstrates:
1.Proficiency in Android app development using Java and XML.
2. Understanding of geometric formulas and calculations.
3. Ability to create user-friendly and intuitive interfaces.
4. Knowledge of the Android SDK and development tools.
